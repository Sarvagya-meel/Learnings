### ðŸ“¦ Activate Poetry Environment (Windows CMD)

To activate the Poetry-managed virtual environment manually from Command Prompt:

```bat
CALL C:\Users\sarva\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\learnings-KLlxmaA9-py3.11\Scripts\activate.bat
```

You can also create a `activate_env.bat` file in your project directory with the same content to quickly activate it.
